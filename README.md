Tries to find proper file in downloads directory, moves 
to directory named lastname_firstname, unzips, checks for proper
directory scheme and tries to fix if necessary, tries to
compile code from A# directory, runs any tests in tests directory
(must have made your own tests directory and tests), opens
vim with all code in reverse sort order and report in
different tabs.

Currently best used with ranger file manager.
